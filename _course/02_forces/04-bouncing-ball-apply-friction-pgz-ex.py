# Create pockets of friction so that objects only experience friction when crossing
# over those pockets.
# What if you vary the strength (friction coefficient) of each area?
# What if you make some pockets feature the opposite of frictionâ€”i.e.,
# when you enter a given pocket you actually speed up instead of slowing down?
