# 1) In the example above, we have a system (i.e. array) of Mover objects and one Attractor object.
# Build an example that has systems of both movers and attractors.
# What if you make the attractors invisible?
# Can you create a pattern/design from the trails of objects moving around attractors?
# See the Metropop Denim project by Clayton Cubitt and Tom Carden for an example:

# 2) It’s worth noting that gravitational attraction is a model we can follow to
# develop our own forces. This chapter isn’t suggesting that you should exclusively
# create sketches that use gravitational attraction. Rather, you should be thinking creatively
# about how to design your own rules to drive the behavior of objects.
# For example, what happens if you design a force that is weaker the closer it gets and
# stronger the farther it gets?
# Or what if you design your attractor to attract faraway objects, but repel close ones?
